What is ELIXIR Norway providing \u00b6 ELIXIR Norway provide service, infrastructure, support and training for life science researchers: The list of services can be found on our Service page in or main web site at elixir.no We provide training events on the use of our services. These are can be found on our Training page and are also announced in ELIXIR's Training Portal (TeSS) We also provide a national support desk for all types of bioinformatics related questions. Info ELIXIR Norway support desk can be contacted directly by sending an email to contact@bioinfo.no What is NeLS and SBI \u00b6 The Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS) is a national portal for sharing, analysis and mid-term storage of non-sensitive molecular life science data developed and operated by ELIXIR Norway . StoreBioInfo (SBI) is for long term storage of project data. A storage quota in this layer is granted upon a successful application to ELIXIR Norway support desk The architecture of NeLS has a tiered structure, with three natural layers that data can reside in. These are the compute layer ( usegalaxy.no ), the NeLS storage layer, and the StoreBioinfo layer. All three serve different purposes in terms of usage: from small capacity, very short term immediate storage with fast access available to compute resources, to large capacity, long term storage, with less flexible access methods and longer access time. What can NeLS be used for? \u00b6 Storage of Life science data Direct data transfer from data producers (e.g. NorSeq ) Sharing of data between project collaborators Data analysis in usegalaxy.no Data submission to public data repositories Annotation of datasets ( SEEK ) Access to NeLS \u00b6 Who can use NeLS? \u00b6 NeLS is accessible to all Norwegian researchers and international research collaborators of their projects. What type of data can be stored in NeLS? \u00b6 NeLS is for storage of non-sensitive Life science data. Sensitive data must be stored using other platforms that allows collection, storage and analysis of sensitive research data in a secure environment, such as TSD or the HUNT Cloud \" How to obtain access to NeLS \u00b6 All users with FEIDE login credentials can access the NeLS Portal at https://nels.bioinfo.no/ . Only prerequisite is that your University/institution need to allow their users to use FEIDE to connect to the NeLS Portal. Tip If you are in doubt whether your University/institution has been connected to the NeLS Portal, please contact the ELIXIR Norway support desk by sending an email to contact@bioinfo.no . We can support you to get your institution connected to our service. To access the NeLS portal, see Accessing NeLS I don't have FEIDE login credentials \u00b6 Ii is also possible to login to NeLS via a NeLS idp. You can apply for a NeLS idp here . Info NeLS ipd are generted only for users that apply with an institutional email address (your email at your institution) and not to e.g. gmail addresses Access to SBI \u00b6 If you have access to NeLS, you also gain access to SBI, given that you are part of a storage project with a storage quota in SBI. Storage quota in SBI \u00b6 Who can get storage quotas in SBI? \u00b6 All research projects with a Norwegian partner with funding from national funding bodies (NFR, Universities, Helseforetak, etc) and EU grants are entitled to store life science data in NeLS. This also includes private companies and governmental research institutions. Research projects (with a Norwegian partner) that do not fall into the definition above can still apply for a storage quota, but these projects will be treated according to the user contribution model for granting storage to projects by Sigma2. Info We currently offer free storage of data up to 10 TB. For larger projects, please contact the ELIXIR Norway support desk by sending an email to contact@bioinfo.no . How can I get a storage quota in SBI? \u00b6 If your data is generated at one of the Norwegian sequencing core facilities organized in NorSeq, your core facility can help you with the application and directly upload the data to your NeLS project. If your data is generated elsewhere, you can contact ELIXIR-NO Helpdesk directly and apply for a storage quota in SBI. Terminology \u00b6 Warning This part of the page is still under construction How safe and secure are data in NeLS? \u00b6 The NeLS storage layer has built-in redundancy against data loss due to hardware failure at disk and server levels. The StoreBioinfo storage layer is implemented on top of the national research data storage solution NIRD , offered by Sigma2 Uninett A/S . This large capacity, mid term data storage layer is protected against data loss by both hardware redundancy mechanisms and asynchronous geo-replicated storage between two cities in Norway. In addition NIRD implements daily snapshots for the last 7 days and weekly snapshots for the last 6 weeks. Note A detailed description of the backup of the system can be found in the NeLS Terms of reference About usegalaxy.no \u00b6 What is usegalaxy.no \u00b6 usegalaxy.no is the national Galaxy server for life science data analysis hosted and maintained by ELIXIR Norway. Galaxy is a web-based platform that provide bioinformatic tools and workflows. usegalaxy.no is open to all Norwegian user and collaborators. You can read more about Galaxy in the Galaxy Community Hub . usegalaxy.no is directly connected to your data storage in NeLS . This exclude the need for local copy of your data. You can simply transfer data directly between usegalaxy.no and NeLS .

Info This access option is used when data needs to be backed up from NeLS in SBI Using ssh through command Line \u00b6 Info In order to access NeLS through a command line, you need to collect some connection details from the NeLS portal. See this section for how to download a private SSH key. After gathering your username and SSH key, you can use ssh to access NeLS with the following command: ssh -i <SSH_key> <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no Absolute path to the home directory is /elixir-chr/nels/users/<username> . Collect connection details from the NeLS portal \u00b6 Access to NeLS using ssh , scp , or sftp (be it via command line or with programs like PuTTY and FileZilla) requires three specific pieces of information: host address [1], username [2] - it differs from FEiDE ID and Idp, and SSH private key associated with the username [3]. All the informations can be found in the Connection Details window of the NeLS portal. To open the window, navigate to the top right corner and select Connection Details form the menu. Screenshots of the menu and the window with highlighted connection details are shown below. Download the SSH key to the computer from which you want to authenticate on NeLS, note the host address ( nelstor0.cbu.uib.no ) and your username. Modify access permissions for the SSH key in such a way that only you can read and write to the file and no other user can access the file. In the linux-based operating systems (including OsX), one can achieve this by typing chmod 600 <SSH_key> into a terminal window. In Windows, one can access the security tab in the Properties option of the <SSH_key> file and keep access granted only to oneself, SYSTEM and Administrators . Transfer data to and from NeLS \u00b6 Upload/Download data using the Web interface of the NeLS portal \u00b6 For quick browsing and simple file access a user can log into NeLS at https://nels.bioinfo.no/ using either their FEiDE identity if they are a member of a Norewegian institution or a NeLS identity which can be created by members of the Elixir Helpdesk with access to the NelS admin tools. This access option is used when data needs to be backed up from NeLS to SBI, for details see section Midterm data storage in NeLS and SBI . Here is a screenshot of the Personal Area in the NeLS portal. The numbered blocks highlight the following features: [1] Upload File(s), Add New Folder; [2] File and folder manipulation; [3] Rename file or folder; [4] (De)select all/some items; [5] Projects Area - the same functionality available there as in the Personal Area. Upload/Download using dedicated programs (FileZilla setup) \u00b6 Programs such as FileZilla and WinSCP can be used to transfer data to and from NeLS. Connection to NeLS has to be properly set up inside the tool\u2019s configuration options providing the host address, username, and the user's SSH key. When using FileZilla, select File from the top menu and open Site Manager... . Click on the New Site button and call the new site NeLS . Perform the following changes to the form: 1. Change Protocol to SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol . 2. Fill in Host from the NeLS Connection Details. 3. Change Logon Type to Key File . 4. Fill in Username from the NeLS Connection Details. 5. Browse for the Key File, allow all file types to show in the pop-up window and select the SSH Key File downloaded from the NeLS portal. The Site Manager Form will at the end look similar to the screenshot below with [1], [2], and [3] highlighting the filled in connection details. Press the Connect button. When the connection to NeLS is successfully established, the content of the local computer is shown in the left-hand side window and the content of NeLS is shown in the right-hand side window. File copying can be done by dragging and dropping files which should be coppied. When connecting to NeLS via FileZilla next time, hover with your cursor over the left-most icon (servers) below the top menu and select NeLS connection when it shows up. Upload/Download via the command line using scp \u00b6 Here is a list of several examples of how to upload files and folders to NeLS using scp command as well as how to download them. In the examples, \\ at the end of the lines indicate command split accross multiple lines and can be omitted. Characters $ and > at the beginning of the lines do not belong to the commands, they only mimic most likely response of a terminal window to the command splitting with \\ . To be able to follow this section, one needs to gather the connection details specified in the section \"Collect the necessary connection details from the NeLS portal\". Upload a file into the Personal folder: $ scp -i <SSH_key> \\ > <file> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Personal Upload a file into a project folder: $ scp -i <SSH_key> \\ > <file> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Projects/<project> Upload a folder (recursive upload, -r option): $ scp -r -i <SSH_key> \\ > <folder> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Personal Download a file from the Personal folder: $ scp -i <SSH_key> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Personal/<file> \\ > <destination_local> Download all files with extension .txt from the Personal folder (wildcard usage): $ scp -i <SSH_key> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Personal/*.txt \\ > <destination_local> Download a folder from a project folder (recursive download, -r option): $ scp -r -i <SSH_key> \\ > <username>@nelstor0.cbu.uib.no:/elixir-chr/nels/users/<username>/Projects/<project>/<folder> \\ > <destination_local> Transfer data to and from SBI \u00b6 SBI is only connected to NeLS. Data has to reside in NeLS before it can be imported in SBI, and data in SBI can only be exported to NeLS. You need to be member of a SBI project before you can transfer data between NeLS and SBI Note The only way to transfer data between NeLS and SBI is through the NeLS Portal web GUI. Data Importing data in SBI \u00b6 You will find all SBI projects you are a member of under the StoreBioInfo menu in the NeLS Portal . You will see both your NeLS projects [1] (Personal and Projects) to the left of the screen and the SBI projects to the right [2]. Select the SBI project you would like to import data in. There might already exist datasets in the project [3], or you can create a new dataset for new datasets. Select the dataset you want to import data into [4] and the subfolder for the data [5]. The subfolder structure is automatically generated when a new dataset is created, and normally contain a folder named rawdata for the data from the data provider (e.g. fastq files prior to analysis) and a folder named analysis for the analysed data (e.g. assemblies and alignment files). On the NeLS side, browser to the project and folders or files that you want to transfer to SBI [1]. Select single files [2] or all files [3]. Make sure you are in the correct destination folder on the SBI side [4], and press Transfer to SBI [5]. Note If you have a large number of files to transfer, you can transfer the whole directory containing the files in NeLS to SBI Create new dataset in SBI \u00b6 Within an existing project [1] you can create a new dataset by pressing + New Dataset [2]. In the window that appear, select the Dataset type form the drop-down menu [3]. You also need to give the dataset a Name [5] and a short Description [5]. Finally, press Create [6] to make the new dataset folder in SBI. Note If you have a large number of files to transfer, you can transfer the whole directory containing the files in NeLS to SBI The new dataset should appear on the list of datasets [1] in the project you created it in [2]. This should also have created subfolders for raw data and analysed data [3]. It is possible to edit the Name and Description of the dataset [4]. Exporting data from SBI \u00b6 Exporting data from SBI to NeLS is similar to importing files to SBI from NeLS. Make sure you are in the correct destination folder on the NeLS side [1]. On the SBI side, browser to the project and folders or files that you want to transfer to SBI [2], and press Transfer to NeLS [3]. Midterm data storage in NeLS and SBI \u00b6 NeLS is meant for storing and sharing active project data. This is typically data that are being analysed and shared with collaborators during a project. Data normally reside here for months/years. SBI is meant for more long term storage of project data. This is typically data that are not being analysed at the moment, but is planned to included later in the project. Data normally reside here for years User roles in NeLS and SBI \u00b6 There are multiple user roles to control read/write permissions and to manage project members. These roles are normally set when the project is made by instructions from the PI, but can be changed during the project. User role NeLS SBI PI Manage File system: Add, Rename, Navigate, Download, Delete all Content, Manage members Add, Navigate, Transfer to NeLS, Manage members Data manager Manage File system: Add, Rename, Navigate, Download, Delete all Content, Manage members Add, Navigate, Transfer to NeLS, Manage members Power user Manage File system: Add, Rename, Navigate, Download, Delete all Content Add, Navigate, Transfer to NeLS, Manage members Normal user Add files & folders, Navigate & Download Navigate & Transfer to NeLS Help desk Manage File system: Add, Rename, Navigate, Download, Delete all Content Add files & folders, Navigate & Transfer to NeLS Core facility Add files & folders, Navigate & Download - Collaborator Add files & folders, Navigate & Download - Note If you need support in changing the role of project members, please contact the ELIXIR Norway support desk by sending an email to contact@bioinfo.no Where to deposit data long term \u00b6 When a project is ready for publication, the data should be deposited in public data repositories (deposition databases or data archives) suitable for the type of data. A project can hold different types of data that should be submitted to different data repositories. Many biomolecular data types can be deposited to the ELIXIR Deposition Databases . ELIXIR Norway is a data broker for the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and support Norwegian users to submit sequence data there. Note If you need support in finding the proper end point for your data, please contact the ELIXIR Norway support desk by sending an email to contact@bioinfo.no Import and export Galaxy histories to and from NeLS \u00b6 usegalaxy.no is directly connected to your data storage in NeLS . We have made a function in the usegalaxy.no that can export a whole history including the data sets in that history as a single compressed file to NeLS . This file can be imported into another Galaxy instance and the analysis work can continue there. The advantage of this export is that all provenance data will be kept, meaning all commands, tool versions, database versions, etc that were used prior to the export. Note Since usegalaxy.no is not meant for storage we encourage you to move your data when your analysis is done. Before getting started \u00b6 Login to https://usegalaxy.no/ with your FEIDE or NeLS idp You need at least one history in usegalaxy.no to export Exporting a history from usegalaxy.no to NeLS \u00b6 Dataset and histories can also be exported from usegalaxy.no to your local system. Note \ud83d\udca1If you have several histories, you would need to repeat the steps below for each history you would like to export. Make sure that the history you want to export is your current (active) history Press the History options [1] and select Export History under the NeLS storage section [2] You will be redirected to the NeLS portal where you need to choose the destination folder [3] (shown here a random subfolder in the Personal folder) Browse to the folder you want to export the history to and press Use current folder [4]. You should be redirected back to usegalaxy.no where you can view the transfer progress (you might need to scroll down a bit in the usegalaxy.no main window). When the transfer is complete, the progression bar will turn green [5] Importing a history from NeLS to usegalaxy.no \u00b6 Both single datasets and complete histories can be imported from your NeLS storage Note \ud83d\udca1When importing data from NeLS, you cannot define the datatype (format). You can change datatype once the datasets are imported into usegalaxy.no Press the History options and select Import History under the NeLS storage section [1] You will be redirected to the NeLS storage. browse to the folder containing the data (example here is a random subfolder in the Project folder), select the history (or file) [2] and press Send to Galaxy [3] *You will be redirected back to usegalaxy.no and you can monitor the progress of the import [4]. The progress bar will turn green when the import is complete [5] The name of the imported history will be imported from archive: .... The history can be accessed by selecting Histories [6] under the User menu. You can rename the history if you like. Delete and permanent delete data in usegalaxy.no \u00b6 Galaxy offer multiple ways to delete datasets and histories. The are two major types of deletion: Delete datasets or histories - This option temporary delete data (basically just hide the data) Permanently delete datasets or histories - This option permanently delete data from the disk Note We strongly encourage that you copy your histories to NeLS and permanently delete data from usegalaxy.no when you are done with your data analysis. This will free up your personal disk space in usegalaxy.no. To backup data to NeLS see this documentation Delete datasets \u00b6 Select the dataset(s) you want to delete (temporary) by pressing X next to the dataset in your History panel [1]. The dataset should disappear from you history, but you still access it [2] You have only temporary deleted the data (equal to moving it to the trash bin on you computer), and it can be undeleted (moved back from trash bin), or permanently deleted by pressing Permanently remove it from disk [3] Press OK to confirm the permanent deletion [4] You can still see traces of the dataset in your history [5], but the data in the file is deleted from the disk and you have freed up disk space Delete complete histories \u00b6 Similarly, you can temporary and permanently delete histories. Access the overview of your histories either by selecting Histories [1] under the User menu or by pressing View all histories [2] in the History panel From the drop-down menu of the history you want to delete (exemplified by the history named imported from archive: .... ), press Delete Permanently [3] for permanent deletion. If you chose the other history view, from the drop-down menu of the history you want to delete press Purge [4]. Both options will ask you to confirm the deletion, and both options will erase the data from disk. Import and export workflows in usegalaxy.no \u00b6 Galaxy offers a simple way to download a workflow as a single file which can be imported into another Galaxy instance and run there. Note Different Galaxy instances may have different versions of the same tool installed. This may cause the Galaxy instance you import the workflow into to throw a warning. In order for the imported and exported workflows to give identical results, the tool versions must be identical There might be individual tool parameter settings that are pre-set in the exported workflow that for some reason are not carried over properly during the import. In order for the imported and exported workflows to give identical results, the individual tool parameter settings must be identical A tool may not be installed in the Galaxy instance you are importing the workflow.
