# Delete and permanent delete data in usegalaxy.no

Galaxy offer multiple ways to delete datasets and histories, and you will try two of them in this exercise. The are two major types of deletion:

1. Delete datasets or histories - This option temporary delete data (basically just hide the data)
2. Permanently delete datasets or histories - This option permanently delete data from the disk











!!! note

     Since usegalaxy.no is not meant for storage we encourage you to move your data when your analysis is done.
     
## Delete datasets and complete histories

I. Make sure your current history is the history you imported from NeLS previously (if you didn't rename it, it should be called something that starts with "**imported from archive: ....**"")

II. Select the dataset(s) you want to delete (temporary) by pressing "**X**" next to the dataset in your "**History**" panel [1]. The dataset should disappear from you history, but you still access it [2]

III. You have only temporary delete the data (equal to moving it to the trash bin on you computer), and it can be undeleted (moved back from trash bin), or permanently deleted by pressing "**Permanetly remove it from disk**" [3]

IV. Press "**OK**" to confirm the permanent deletion

V. You can still see traces of the dataset in your history [5], but the data in the file is deleted from the disk and you have freed up disk space:)
