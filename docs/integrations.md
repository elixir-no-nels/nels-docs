# Integrations

## NeLS - SEEK integration
NeLS can be integrated with [SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) to keep track of metadata.

To allow linking project in NeLS and in a SEEK instance (such as the public [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/)) this has to be enabled by admins on both sides contact the <a href="mailto:contact@bioinfo.no?subject=NeLS-SEEK integration">ELIXIR-NO Helpdesk</a> and an admin of your SEEK instance for this.

After the integration is enabled you can:

* Reference data in NeLS:StoreBioInfo from SEEK by using the "Add data from NeLS" button on an Assay in SEEK
* Open data regisitered in SEEK in NeLS:StoreBioInfo by using the "Open in NeLs" button while viewing a data file in SEEK
* Import Metadata stored in NeLS:StoreBioInfo along with your dat to SEEK if it follows the same convention as your SEEK project by using the "Fetch sample metadata" button while viewing a data file in SEEK

More information can be found in the [SEEK documentation](https://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/nels-integration.html)
